            dough of butter, sugar, eggs, flour, and baking soda, mixed with
            chocolate chips. The dough is scooped onto baking sheets and baked
            until golden brown, resulting in cookies that are crispy on the
            edges and chewy in the center. These cookies are enjoyed warm with a
            glass of milk or as a sweet snack.

          <br />
          <p>
            Spaghetti Carbonara is a traditional Italian pasta dish from Rome.
            It features spaghetti tossed in a creamy sauce made with eggs,
            Pecorino Romano cheese, pancetta (or guanciale), and black pepper.
            The heat from the pasta cooks the eggs, creating a rich, velvety
            sauce that coats each strand of spaghetti. It's a quick, hearty, and
            indulgent meal.
